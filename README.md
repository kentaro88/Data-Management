# Data-Management

## Goal 
To understand the implementation of data management.
I have worked on both type of database RDBMS and NoSQL.

## Data 
I used 2 types datasets from [USDA nutrient database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/) 
The first database is small size of data which is used in the first project([1_MySQL.sql](https://github.com/kentaro88/Data-Management/blob/master/1_MySQL.sql)), whereas the second is bigger database that I used on the second([2_MySQL.sql](https://github.com/kentaro88/Data-Management/blob/master/2_MySQL.sql)) and third project([3_mongoDB.js](https://github.com/kentaro88/Data-Management/blob/master/3_mongoDB.js))
